This is where I spend most of my time studying, printing assignments and attending a lot of my tutorials.</p><p>There have been some stressful moments here, but there have also been many moments of happiness in this building. Like, the final exhibition of my work and the end of the semester and fun group (and procrastination) sessions.</p><p>One of my favourite moments would have to be when I was about to leave to get lunch and people came over and gave me free pizza left over from their stall. These random acts of kindness are always occurring in the design building, as there is a real sense of tired comradery. Particularly when assignments are due.</p><p>It is also a beautiful space, and having classes in the atrium (or hanging beehive) is as fun as it looks.</p><p>I only did my core design subjects in the MSD building, but it was a great space to interact with people from older years and with people who are doing different majors. It is a very communal space, and everyone is very welcome and happy to work together!</p><p>There are also lots of people from other faculties that chose to use the MSD Building because of its light and open space. It&rsquo;s the perfect space for group work and open discussions.</p><hr style="margin-bottom: 25px;" /><p>Hear more about my time at the University of Melbourne at other iconic landmarks around campus.</p><p>See you at the next spot!</p></div></li></ul></li><li class="simple-listing__item"><div class="with-figure clearfix"><figure class="figure figure--left figure--min"><img alt="cute kitten" class="figure__content" src="http://placekitten.com/1000/1000" /></figure><h3 class="simple-listing__heading">Chloe Harris</h3><p class="simple-listing__excerpt">Short description.

Sometimes the fact that it&rsquo;s busy can be a good thing, as you&rsquo;ll work in an environment surrounded by a huge variety of people studying a huge variety of things. There&rsquo;s always something new to learn!</p><p>I used to observe the design students drawing parts of the building while getting feedback from the tutors, which was always fascinating.</p><p>I studied a breadth subject, Critical Thinking with Data, in Old Geology, the building across the path. It gave me a great insight into something different, and really helped with the GAMSAT test for when I hopefully go on to study medicine.</p><hr style="margin-bottom: 25px;" /><p>You can check out more about my story at the University of Melbourne at other places around campus.</p><p>See you there!</p></div></li></ul></li><li class="simple-listing__item"><div class="with-figure clearfix"><figure class="figure figure--left figure--min"><img alt="cute kitten" class="figure__content" src="http://placekitten.com/g/700/700" /></figure><h3 class="simple-listing__heading">Chris Phung</h3><p class="simple-listing__excerpt">Short description.

It seems daunting before you start to meet others, and before you know it, the lecture theatre that used to be scary is now packed with familiar faces, including one of my best friends who ended up studying Architecture and gave me an excuse to visit the MSD more often.</p><p>I initially began my studies in science listening to brilliant biology lectures in these huge theatres. But it was actually across the road in the Physics building that I realised that my lifetime passion lay within the field of arts.</p><p>It was through my breadth subject, The Developing World, that expanded my horizons of what I wanted to achieve with my degree.</p><p>Sitting in the theatre across from the MSD every week and understanding more about what inspired me, I would eventually go on to transfer over to Arts and pursue my passion to understand more about the world and help to solve inequality in all its forms. Yet, I was still able to study biology (a subject which I still thoroughly enjoy) through breadth subjects.</p><hr style="margin-bottom: 25px;" /><p>You can hear more about my time at the University of Melbourne at other spots around campus.</p><p>See you there!</p></div></li></ul></li><li class="simple-listing__item"><div class="with-figure clearfix"><figure class="figure figure--left figure--min"><img alt="cute kitten" class="figure__content" src="http://placekitten.com/g/400/400" /></figure><h3 class="simple-listing__heading">James Pallasis</h3><p class="simple-listing__excerpt">Short description.

This became a perfect time to catch up with friends, especially on a Monday morning!</p><hr style="margin-bottom: 25px;" /><p>You can hear more about my University of Melbourne experiences at various other locations around the campus.</p><p>See you later!</p></div></li></ul></li></ul>
