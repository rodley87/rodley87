My second lecture was for Japanese, and this was in the Old Arts Building. I made it to the Old Quad thinking that Old Arts, and Old Quad were the same. They weren&rsquo;t.</p><p>At this point I panicked a bit, but kept a cool enough head to ask someone who was friendly enough to get me to the lecture theatre.</p><p>For the record, I wasn&rsquo;t even late &ndash; so I panicked for nothing.</p><p>If you ever find yourself lost at The University Of Melbourne, just remember that there are friendly people everywhere who can help you find wherever you need to go.</p><hr /><p>You can hear more about my experiences with the University of Melbourne at other iconic landmarks around campus.</p><p>See you soon!</p></div></li></ul></li><li class="simple-listing__item"><div class="with-figure clearfix"><figure class="figure figure--left figure--min"><img alt="cute kitten" class="figure__content" src="http://placekitten.com/1000/1000" /></figure><h3 class="simple-listing__heading">Chloe Harris</h3><p class="simple-listing__excerpt">Short description.

I&rsquo;m doing a double major in Architecture and Construction, and you are looking at the Clocktower and Old Quad.</p><hr /><p>I&rsquo;ve studied quite a bit of architectural history, which definitely taught me to appreciate the beauty and history behind the architectural form of the Old Quad, which I enjoy every time I pass through from the South Lawn.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve always had quite a special relationship with the Old Quad, ever since I took the subject Foundations of Design: Representation.</p><p>One of our assignments involved remodelling the Old Quad using a modelling software called Rhino.</p><p>We were required to adapt this space into a stage for an interpretation of a story written by Marco Polo, then we used Photoshop to put the characters into the scenes.</p><p>This was one of my core subjects, but it was interesting to see how different students who were studying different majors interpreted the task. Those who were majoring in graphic design were much better at using the software and those who were looking at doing landscape architecture focused more on the setting rather than the characters and story.</p><p>This is one of the best things about the Melbourne model, as people from all backgrounds and with different end goals come together to do the same work. It really opens your eyes to different and innovative ways to approach a task, and definitely helps you learn more broadly.</p><hr /><p>You can hear more about my time at the University of Melbourne at other iconic landmarks around the campus.</p><p>See you then!</p></div></li></ul></li><li class="simple-listing__item"><div class="with-figure clearfix"><figure class="figure figure--left figure--min"><img alt="cute kitten" class="figure__content" src="http://placekitten.com/g/200/200" /></figure><h3 class="simple-listing__heading">Sheena Chen</h3><p class="simple-listing__excerpt">Short description.

It is the typical landmark, meeting point, and a central part of the university.</p><p>Before I came to the University of Melbourne, I searched for it online and the Old Quad is the first picture that popped out. So, the Old Quad became my first impression of the university.</p><p>Thanks to the Melbourne Model, I have the opportunity to study some interesting breadth subjects. Every time I walk to go to my mathematic class, which is on the other side of campus, I will deliberately choose the way that travels through the Old Quad to enjoy the beauty of the building. I can feel that my uni life started from here and will spread from here.</p><hr /><p>You can hear more about my time at the University of Melbourne at other iconic landmarks around campus.</p><p>See you at the next spot!</p></div></li></ul></li></ul>
