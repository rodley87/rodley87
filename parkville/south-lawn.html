We just relax and all sit around together in the heat of the sun. It is great because you always bump into people you don&rsquo;t always get to see and a group of 2 can quickly turn into a huge lunch of 20 people.</p><p>This is also a great space to meet up with different people from different faculties, which is one of the key factors of the Melbourne Model. The South Lawn is a great space to learn from new people and extend your knowledge past what you learn in your major subjects because you always bump into people who you might not meet otherwise.</p><p>There&rsquo;s also often free food, club events and fun activities.</p><p>I definitely see this as the epicentre of Melbourne Uni culture.</p><hr style="margin-bottom: 25px;" /><p>You can hear more about my time at the University of Melbourne at other iconic landmarks around campus.</p><p>See you there!</p></div></li></ul></li><li class="simple-listing__item"><div class="with-figure clearfix"><figure class="figure figure--left figure--min"><a href="#" class="james"></a></figure><h3 class="simple-listing__heading">James Pallasis</h3><p class="simple-listing__excerpt">Short description.

I had never seen this many people in one place at the same time before.</p><p>On top of that, the numbers of clubs and societies there also seemed impossible. I later found out that this wasn&rsquo;t even all of them.</p><p>At that point, I realised uni was not going to be as straightforward as high school &ndash; I had a lot more choices and was going to have to make some decisions and step out of my comfort zone &ndash; but that is how you grow as a person.</p><p>Also, as my host predicted, I didn&rsquo;t see my host group for the rest of that day &ndash; we just kind of got absorbed into the South Lawn crowd.</p><hr style="margin-bottom: 25px;" /> You can hear more about my time at the University of Melbourne at other iconic landmarks around campus. <p>See you soon!</p></div></li></ul></li></ul>
